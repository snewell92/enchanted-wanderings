# Enchanted Wanderings

This is the config and set up of the Enchanted Wandering modpack, distributed as an `.mrpack`
following the modrinth format, compatible with Prism Launcher and Modrinth.

## Modlist

Instead of committing a bunch of jars, we just run:

```sh
ls ./mods/ > modlist.txt
```

to document what mods exist in the pack. This is doubly documented in the `.mrpack`
